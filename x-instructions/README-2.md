## Description

```
This app is a social network API that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. This app uses the following technology:

* Express - server
* Mongo - "local" database 
* Mongoose 
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```

## Installation

Setup: 
- (1) Fork the repo, (2) Clone the forked repo locally, (3) Run "npm install" (to install the dependencies).

Setup the Database Schema / Run Server: 
- Note that Mongo needs to be used for the database. The config file is setup to run on "mongodb://localhost/socialNetwork".
- Run Server: From the root directory, run either "npm start" or if nodemon is available "nodemon" to start nodeman or "node index.js".

Seed the Database: 
- Run "npm run seed" from the root directory. This should create a Mongo "socialNetwork" db.

## Usage

This app is a deployed solely on the back-end using Node.js, Express, Mongo, Mongoose and Insomia (for the API route testing).

## Features

This app includes a variety of API routes (see list below). In addition, the following features exist.

1. Email validation using "match" schema function
2. "Virtual" friends and reactions count
3. "Getter" method to format the time stamp using the native JavaScript `Date` object to format timestamps (`new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', options).format(date)`). See `utils/helpers.js`
4. Sub/nest-document for the "reactionsSchema"
5. Self-reference join for the friends list/array
6. "Populate" (join) for the thoughts and friends list/array
7. "addReactions" controller ensures a reaction doesn't exist prior to insertion
8. **BONUS** "createThought" controller adds the thought._id to the user's associated thoughts array
9. **BONUS** "deleteThought" controller deletes the thought._id from the user's associated thoughts array
10. **BONUS** Robust seed code for all data
